            Use the SQL_COPT_SS_CONNECT_RETRY_INTERVAL (read only) connection attribute to retrieve the length of the connection retry interval.
            Connection will be retried at least once by default.

Added:
    - Support for SQL_COPT_SS_CEKCACHETTL and SQL_COPT_SS_TRUSTEDCMKPATHS connection attributes
            SQL_COPT_SS_CEKCACHETTL Allows controlling the time that the local cache of Column Encryption Keys exists, as well as flushing it
            SQL_COPT_SS_TRUSTEDCMKPATHS Allows the application to restrict AE operations to only use the specified list of Column Master Keys

    - Support for loading the .rll from default location
    
17.0.1.0 - 2017/01/16
Known Issues:
    None

Fixed:
    Fixed SQLGetData for encrypted varbinary(max) returned data only on first call
    Conversions to persian collation in column scenarios appears to result in data corruption.
    Data corruption when streaming UTF-16 or UTF-8 using SQLPutData with split octets or surrogate pairs
    With async notifications enabled, driver unable to recover from failure (Windows)
    High cpu consumption when ODBC async execution mode is enabled (Windows)
    Occasional crash during ODBC shutdown when async execution mode is enabled (Windows)
	
Added:
    Performance improvement for when ODBC async execution mode is enabled

17.0.0.5 - 2017/12/20

Known Issues:
    - macOS: Homebrew now filters out user set environment variables. You can now install the ODBC driver on macOS using the
      following command line:
        HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1 ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install --no-sandbox msodbcsql

Fixed:
    - Parameters bound with any convertable C type with the same precision & scale as a numeric/decimal column are now
      correctly converted to the appropriate numeric type with the specified precision and scale, and execute successfully
      instead of erroring our with Operand Type Clash.      
    - Screen reader usability improvements in DSN Wizard and Login Dialog
    - Encrypted numeric/decimal values now correctly normalize negative zeros
    - Hebrew data (varchar) is no longer chopped when returned as wide chars on Linux platforms
    - Fixed Invalid Descriptor Index error when using unencrypted XML column with AE in some scenarios
    - Fixed function sequence error when using DAE, SqlPutData, and AE
    - ODBC Driver on Windows now links directly to secur32.dll, instead of indirectly through security.dll

Added:
    - Support for macOS High Sierra
    - Support for Ubuntu 17.10
    - Always Encrypted support for BCP API
    - Greater than 10x performance improvement when driver converts to/from UTF-8/16.
    - New connection string attribute UseFMTOnly causes driver to use legacy metadata in special cases requiring temp tables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.0.0.1 - 2017/10/06

Known Issues:
    None

Fixed:
    msodbcsql.h - Missing types and constants were added to Linux/Mac header
    CP1252 encoded files over 32MB were failing to import correctly with bcp on Linux. This has been fixed.
    Resolved an issue in Linux where system time changes could result in incorrect timeouts in the driver
    macOS - SQLGetInfo with SQL_DRIVER_NAME retruns .so value instead of .dylib

Added:
    Support for Debian 9
    Improved performance of driver character conversion from utf16
    Changed narrow functions of ODBC API to be sensitive to platform encoding, and not assume UTF-8. Wide encoding is expected to be UTF-16LE
    Removed Microsoft online service sign-in assistant check in ODBC driver for Windows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.1.9.0 - 2017/06/14

Known Issues:
 None

Fixed:
#10274176: DSN Wizard Help does not load CHM
#10034310: Fix buffer overrun upon UTF-8 character conversion - Now fully supports UTF-8

Added:
Support for Ubuntu 14.04.
Configurable driver location on Linux.  Simply copy the whole driver install directory to the location of your choice after normal installation.
  You must manually update the ODBCINST.INI file with the new location.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.1.8.0 - 2017/05/18

Known Issues:
- Due to the buffer overrun fix (#10034310, see below), UTF-8 non-ASCII
  characters may cause column truncation after conversion to UTF-16. In
  particular, use of SQLBulkOperations with column bindings may cause
  this to occur. A future release will fully support UTF-8. See
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux/known-issues-in-this-version-of-the-driver
  for more information.

Fixed:
#10059224: Floating-point numbers formatted incorrectly in French locale
#10144395: SQLBindParameter input/output parameters may truncate prematurely
#10060645: Implicit cursor conversion due to comments
#10034310: Fix buffer overrun upon UTF-8 character conversion
#1080065: Fixed symbolic link creation for the RPM package
